Text summarization can broadly be divided into two categories â€” Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization.

Extractive Summarization: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.
Abstractive Summarization: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may not even appear in the original text.
